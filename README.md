# Eviction Filing Rates & Homelessness

Using data from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Princeton University Eviction Lab, the US Census Bureau and the MIT Elections Lab, I create a panel dataset observing rate of eviction filings and rate of homelessness by state by year, plus political leaning and population density ranking by state. I explore the data and create a couple of regression models to assess whether a state's rate of eviction filings can indicate higher levels of homelessness.

## Currently working on: ##
- Cleaning up code to better adhere to best practices & improve readability
- Looking for the bottom of the rabbit hole of model assumption violations -_-
  
### General thoughts & comments ###

**2/28**: So far I don't think there's much evidence of filerate & homelesscap being significantly related in any way. But at the same time I am very out of my depth; both variables of interest seem very multimodal and I have not really worked with multimodal distributions before. Not sure if this rabbit hole will lead anywhere but oh well. And I'm still not 100% sure I understand the difference between the Least Squares Dummy Variable and within-fixed effects models so I'll just keep scouring the internet I guess!

I doubt I will get to the point of confidently drawing any conclusions from what I have here, at my current level of skill and experience (and with my distrust of this dataset (mostly the PIT, and also my methods of aggregation during the cleaning process)). I may pivot slightly and try going back to working with counties instead of states.

# Eviction Filing Rates & Homelessness

Using data from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Princeton University Eviction Lab, the US Census Bureau and the MIT Elections Lab, I create a panel dataset observing rate of eviction filings and rate of homelessness by state by year, plus political leaning and population density ranking by state. I explore the data and create a couple of regression models to assess whether more eviction filings is indicative of more homelessness in a state.
